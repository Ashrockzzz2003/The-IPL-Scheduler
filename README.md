# The-IPL-Scheduler
The IPL Scheduler is built based on the Indian Premier League(IPL). 

- It schedules matches between teams, assigns venues, time, day and Match Number to matches.
- In IPL, every team plays with every other team in a double round robin format.
- It's also required to give at least a day's gap between consecutive matches for each team, to ensure equal chance to all teams.
